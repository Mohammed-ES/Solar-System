# 🌍🚀 3D Solar System 🌞✨  

This project is an interactive 3D visualization of the solar system. It offers an immersive experience that allows users to explore the various planets and manipulate different parameters such as view, zoom, rotation speed, size, and distance between the planets. 🌌🪐  

## 🌟 Features  

- 🔭 **3D/2D View**: Toggle between a three-dimensional representation and a simplified 2D view of the solar system.  
- 🔍 **Zoom**: Adjust the zoom level to observe the entire solar system or get closer to a specific planet.  
- 🔄 **Rotation Speed**: Change the speed at which the planets orbit the sun for better visualization of their orbits.  
- 🌏 **Planet Size**: Increase or decrease the sizes of the planets for easier observation.  
- 📏 **Distance Between Planets**: Adjust the relative distances between the planets to better understand their arrangement in space.  
- ℹ️ **Information Display**: Show detailed information about each planet, such as its diameter, distance from the Sun, composition, and other characteristics.  
- 🌙 **Day/Night Mode**: Switch between a daytime display mode and a nighttime viewing mode for better immersion.
